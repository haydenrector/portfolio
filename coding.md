## Digital Logic Projects
### Clock

## Custom Arduino Designed For Sun Sensor Array with Live Pointing
### Overview
- Designed for CubeSats, UAVs, and balloon payloads (modular, open source hardware)
- Calculates sun angle from sensor array and displays with live telemetry on dashboard
- Uses vector calculation and PID tracking for calculating sun angle
- TinyML sun-prediction algorithm (can detect clouds/light changes)
