College student at College of the Canyons, Valencia, CA and an aspiring transfer student

I love to...
- fix random and old electronics
- build little things for everyday life
- working with a team to make robots or rockets
- watch battlebots and host rocket launch watch parties


I attended public high school for two years, but decided to apply to private, boarding schools in hopes for a rigourous education. For my junior and senior year I attended Deerfield Academy where I expanded my passion for STEM with high-level courses. Now, as a community college student trying to save money, I am on a mission to obtain a rigourous college education when I transfer as a sophomore. Welcome to my personal curiosity outlet where I articulate my ideas into the form of videos, images, and words!
